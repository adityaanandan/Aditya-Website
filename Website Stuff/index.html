Over the past few years, I've created a bunch of projects which involve gaming, data analysis, and cybersecurity.

Therefore, through my published book: "Leveling Up: An Interactive Guide to Programming and Game Design", I hope to simplify and make CS more fun! </p>
                    <p class = "pic"> "Leveling Up" consists of three levels, each with a higher difficulty level. Each level will contain 5-7 projects that will convey programming or game design concepts. Click the link above to see my book on GitBook, or buy the full version on Amazon! </p>
